# library-app

I will create an app that allow you to add a book you read with a button that allows you to choose if the book was read or not and a button that allow you to delete a book from the list.

This exercise was used to practice objects.

For some reason i had to use a loop to append elements to the container when clicking 'ADD BOOK';
